# About Me

I am a Ph.D. student of Political Science at Binghamton University, SUNY. I received my BA in Political Science at Işık University in 2016, and my MA in Political Science at Binghamton University, SUNY in 2021. My research topics include contentious politics, coups, human rights, and state repression.

Broadly speaking, my current work examines when and how leaders use state apparatus to repress opposition in authoritarian countries. In this venture, I combine innovative quantitative methodologies with in-depth interviews and fieldwork.
