## Overview

This course is an introduction to the political systems of countries around the world. Students will gain an understanding of the variety of political structures and processes that exist across the globe, as well as the political parties, social groups and other political actors that influence politics and public policy. The topics we will discuss include political ideologies, constitutions, legislatures, elections and voting behavior, political parties, and social movements. We will also examine how a countryâ€™s history, geography, and economy shape its politics. Although the course is structured thematically, we will draw on a wide variety of country cases to illustrate the concepts we discuss.
