## Course Description

This course offers experience in discovering, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data drawn from various real-world professional, social, and cultural contexts. Students will gain enhanced data literacy, an immersion into critical data studies, an understanding of the processes behind data-driven decision-making, and the ability to interpret claims based on data and its visualization. They will also explore the problems inherent in data-driven approaches, such as missing data, algorithmic bias, and privacy and surveillance concerns, with a special focus on those communities that are often marginalized or disadvantaged by data-driven decisions.
