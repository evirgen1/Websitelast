## Overview

This course is an introduction of the methods and theory of quantitative analysis of documents and natural language processing. Students will learn to use modern tools and Python packages to analyze texts as individual words, sentences, and entire documents. Topics may include word counting, topic modelling, machine translation, regular expressions, and sentiment analysis. Prior programming experience is useful. This course is only open to students with sophomore standing or higher.

## Research Project Guidelines

The research project requires students to:
1. Select an advanced algorithm not covered in depth in the course
2. Research its theoretical foundations
3. Implement the algorithm (when applicable)
4. Analyze its performance empirically
