## Course Description

This intensive math bootcamp is designed specifically for political science students seeking to build the quantitative foundations necessary for success in advanced coursework in statistical modeling and game theory. The course covers essential mathematical tools—including linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, and basic optimization—through the lens of political analysis. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the core mathematical skills needed to confidently engage with formal models, quantitative data, and theoretical frameworks in political science research.
