**Location:** Science Building, Room 301  
**Time:** Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:00-3:15pm

## Course Description

This graduate-level course covers advanced research methods and statistical analysis techniques used in [your field]. Students will learn to design rigorous research studies, collect and analyze data, and interpret results using state-of-the-art methods.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Design methodologically sound research studies
- Select appropriate statistical methods for different research questions
- Conduct advanced data analysis using R and Python
- Interpret and communicate research findings effectively
- Critically evaluate research in academic literature

## Assessment

- **Problem Sets (40%)**: Five problem sets throughout the semester
- **Mid-term Exam (20%)**: Covering weeks 1-5
- **Final Project (30%)**: Original research design and analysis
- **Participation (10%)**: In-class discussions and activities

## Code Demonstrations

Throughout the course, we'll work with code examples like this:

```R
# Example of mixed-effects model in R
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)

# Fit a mixed-effects model
model <- lmer(score ~ treatment + (1|subject), data=experiment_data)

# View the summary of the model
summary(model)
```
