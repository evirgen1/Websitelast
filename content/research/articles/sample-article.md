abstract: "This study examines the impacts of rising sea levels and temperature changes on coastal ecosystems, with particular focus on mangrove forests and coral reefs. Using data collected over a ten-year period, we demonstrate that these ecosystems show varying degrees of resilience and adaptation to climate stressors. Our findings suggest that integrated conservation approaches that consider both direct human impacts and climate change are most effective for preserving these critical habitats."
