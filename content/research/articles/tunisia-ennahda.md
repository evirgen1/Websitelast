abstract: "The Middle East is a region of farreaching importance due to past and current events in global politics. Of the many different dynamics and factors that affect the situation of the Middle East, Islam is especially crucial. Many scholars have recently focused on Islamist movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood, and how they affect the Middle East and beyond. Other movements, arguably of equal importance, have received less academic attention. In Political Islam in Tunisia, Anne Wolf, a doctoral student at Oxford University, brings timely critical attention to the history of Tunisia's primary Islamist movement, al-Nahda."
