abstract: "How do leaders choose governors? This study explores the appointment process for governors by leaders in Turkey, focusing on the relationship between political repression and vote-share dynamics. We hypothesize that leaders strategically appoint more repressive governors and police chiefs in cities where the governing party holds less electoral support and, conversely, select less repressive ones in areas of stronger party backing. We collect data from 1993 to 2020, examining the political ideology and experience of appointees and repression events in cities. Findings reveal that leaders' selection strategies go beyond considering individual merit and the political alignment of the appointees. They also strategically consider the repressive attitude, serving as a signaling mechanism to the governing party."
