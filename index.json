This class will help to explore scholarship from comparative politics, international relations, and political sociology that focuses on the development of social movements and the outcomes that they produce. As we connect history, theory, and scholarship to contemporary politics, key questions will include: How do social movements mobilize under different regime types? Does state repression deter contentious collective action? When do protests lead to political change?\nLearning Objectives By the end of this course, you should have a good understanding of the major theoretical debates about social movements and protests and cursory knowledge of several different social movements and protests in several countries such as the United States, China, Russia, Ukraine, Egypt, Turkey, Mexico, etc. While this is not a course in current events, I expect you to be familiar with contemporary issues in world politics. Even a minimal effort to familiarize yourself with current happenings – in light of the material covered in class – is likely to greatly increase your returns from this course.By the end of this course, you should have a good understanding of the major theoretical debates about social movements and protests and cursory knowledge of several different social movements and protests in several countries such as the United States, China, Russia, Ukraine, Egypt, Turkey, Mexico, etc. While this is not a course in current events, I expect you to be familiar with contemporary issues in world politics. Even a minimal effort to familiarize yourself with current happenings – in light of the material covered in class – is likely to greatly increase your returns from this course.\nCourse Structure Lectures: Thursday 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM Office Hours: Friday 1:30-3:00 PM, and by appointment Required Materials Readings and Course Materials: There are no required books for this course. Our reading list includes scholarly articles and book chapters, as well as some news articles, op-eds, or other popular media. In most cases you will be able to access them online. Occasionally I may distribute notes and/or reading guides to aid your comprehension. You should come to class prepared to discuss the items listed under each day. On days without a class meeting, the items listed are for you to engage in lieu of a seminar meeting. Some of the material will be technically and theoretically challenging (e.g., some of the scholarly articles utilize formal mathematical modeling and/or advanced statistics). I do not expect any of you to have any background in advanced political research methods and, in most cases, my main concern is not in the technical details. Rather, my goal is for you to develop an intuitive understanding of the central arguments and conclusions and for you to be able to explain them. Assessment Component Percentage Due Dates Attendance and Participation 15% Ongoing Midterm Exam 20% October 13 Movie Review 15% October 6 Case Study Presentation 15% Week 11 Final Paper 35% Finals Week Course Content Part I: Defining Social Movements and Mobilization (Week 1 - 7) Theoretical foundations: collective action theories Resource mobilization theory Political process and opportunity structures Framing processes and movement narratives Transnational movements and globalization Digital activism and social media mobilization Movement organizations and networks Part II: State Repression and Movement Outcomes (Weeks 8-10) State responses to contention: repression and concessions Tactical innovation and adaptation Movement impacts on policy and politics Cultural and social outcomes of movements Activist biographies and movement participation Emotions and identity in movement dynamics Movement decline and demobilization Part III: Protests Around the World (Weeks 11-14) Arab Spring and Middle East movements Protest in authoritarian regimes Democracy movements in East Asia Economic justice and anti-austerity protests Environmental and climate movements Racial justice and civil rights movements Gender, sexuality, and protest politics Assignment Details Attendance \u0026amp; Participation (15%) Please, make all reasonable attempts to let me know of circumstances that may impact your ability to fulfill your course obligations as soon as possible. It is your responsibility to read carefully the assigned readings, to attend and participate in all class meetings/activities, and to write and turn in written assignments on time and in the appropriate format. I trust you will respect all in the class by avoiding excessively late arrivals, repeated early exits, or otherwise disruptive behavior. I am just going to assume that a) none of us would be so unscrupulous as to take unfair advantage of my – and others\u0026rsquo; – willingness to be generous and flexible with each other and b) all of us will abide by the principle that honesty, integrity, and care for others in our communications and our scholarship is of paramount importance.\nMidterm Exam (20%) The midterm exam is designed to demonstrate how well you understand the foundational social movement theories. They will be multiple choice/short answer in format. Midterm exam will be held on October 13.\nCase Study Presentation (15%) Each student will select a case study from the list in the Course Schedule and make an in-class presentation (15-20 minutes) based on the article and own research about the case. The presentation slides should be sent as an email to me no later than 5 p.m. on Thursday (the class day).\nMovie Reviews (15%) You will write a critical review (4-5 pages each, standard formatting) of one of the films on our syllabus. These papers are not to be film summaries. Rather, they are meant to engage your ability to synthesize and critique the material in the film in light of our course materials. For example, you might discuss how the film delves further into a key definition or dynamic that we discussed in class (or not), addresses unanswered questions, or highlights something new that you hadn\u0026rsquo;t yet considered. You should run your off-syllabus film choice past me no later than October 6. The papers are due by December 8.\nMovies are: I am not Your Negro, The Square, There is No Evil, 13th, Passing, The Trial of Chicago 7, Beats of No Nation, Suffragette, Winter on Fire: Ukraine\u0026rsquo;s Fight For Freedom, The Help (2011).\nFinal Paper (35%) You will write a final (research) paper on any social movement of your choosing. You can choose a social movement by considering the syllabus but your arguments and analysis should be different from the articles that we read in the class. The main purpose of the final paper will be to incorporate theories and concepts from the readings and the course into an analysis of the social movement that you choose. All written assignments should be double-spaced and use a 12-point font Times New Roman. Final paper should be around 10-15 pages. The final paper is due on December 15.\nWeekly Schedule Week Topics Readings 1 Introduction to Social Movement Theory McAdam, D., McCarthy, J. D., \u0026amp; Zald, M. N.
